The program - universal shim calculator for Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha. This prog helps you to calculate thickness and interchangebility of your engine shims. It can save your money because you don't need always to buy additional shims.
This prog finally gives you the list of shims you have to buy (with partnumbers) and also shows you what shims you can interchange in your engine.
It is based on old PC-only version which runs only under Win32. I'd like to rewrite it in Python for multi-platform usage assuming all suggestions for better tool.
Any feedback and comments appreciated.
